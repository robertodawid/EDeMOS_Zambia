## Crete a new environment in Conda

The attached _*.yml_ will allow you to create a new environment in Conda. The new environment has been tested and is working (there are no issues with libraries like gdal, h3, h3pandas, and others).  
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Useful data sets

1. Transmission lines 220 kV, 132 kV, others.
[Kenya electricity network](#https://energydata.info/dataset/kenya-kenya-electricity-network)
2. Kenya Population and Housing Census 2019. [KNBS, 2019](https://open.africa/dataset/2019-kenya-population-and-housing-census).
3. Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). [DHS](https://dhsprogram.com/data/dataset/Kenya_Standard-DHS_2022.cfm)
4. A high-resolution gridded dataset to assess electrification in sub-Saharan Africa [^1].
5. Gridded global Gross Domestic Product and Human Development Index datasets over 1990–2015 [^2]. 
6. High-Resolution Electricity Access. set_lightscore_sy_xxxx.tif: Predicted likelihood that a settlement is electrified (0 to 1) [^3].
7. Relative Wealth Index (RWI) [^4].
8. Gridded population estimates from building footprints [^5].
